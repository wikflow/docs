# WIKIO AI vs Pitchy

## Executive Summary

**Pitchy** is a French video creation platform (€40M raised, founded 2013) that enables non-video professionals to create simple corporate videos from templates. Their "Do It Yourself" approach targets HR, training, and internal communications teams who need to produce basic video content quickly without hiring agencies. Think: templated training videos, employee onboarding, simple product presentations—created by people who've never edited video before.

**WIKIO AI** is a professional video collaboration platform for media teams producing high-quality content. We serve production workflows where collaboration between creators, editors, stakeholders, and reviewers is essential. Our AI-powered platform handles the complexity of real video production: multi-stakeholder coordination, intelligent search across footage, automated workflows, and content adaptation at scale.

4. **Export** your video

**Designed for:**

### Pitchy's Strengths

**Accessibility:**

- Template-based approach reduces learning curve
- Faster than learning Adobe Premiere or hiring agencies
- Mobile app for simple capture and editing

**Cost Efficiency (for their use case):**
- Cheaper than hiring video agencies repeatedly

### Pitchy's Limitations (For Professional Production)

❌ **Not for complex production workflows** - Templates only, not professional editing  
❌ **No real collaboration features** - Basic sharing, not multi-stakeholder workflows  
❌ **Limited creative control** - Constrained by template structures  
❌ **Template aesthetic** - Videos look like... templates  
❌ **Not built for news/media workflows** - Corporate comms focus  
❌ **No intelligent content search** - Creating new, not searching existing  
❌ **Basic AI capabilities** - Recently added, not core to platform  
❌ **Can't handle professional footage** - Works with simple clips and photos  

<Info>
  **Pitchy's Target Reality**: Their case studies are France Travail (employment agency training), EDF (employee videos), Bouygues (learning videos). These are corporate training and internal comms—not professional media production.

## The Bottom Line

**Pitchy and WIKIO AI barely compete**—they solve fundamentally different problems for different users:

**Pitchy democratizes video creation**: They make it possible for HR departments, training teams, and internal communicators to create simple videos without video skills or agency budgets. For their target audience (non-professionals making templated corporate videos), they've built an excellent solution.

**WIKIO AI powers professional collaboration**: We enable media teams and professional creators to work together efficiently on complex video projects, with AI-powered intelligence that makes workflows faster and smarter. For our target audience (professional video production teams), we consolidate multiple tools into one platform.

### The One Question:

**"Are you creating simple videos from templates, or collaborating on professional video production?"**

- **Templates** → Pitchy is purpose-built for you
- **Production** → WIKIO AI is your platform

Both tools can exist happily because they serve different needs. A large organization might even use both: Pitchy for HR training videos, WIKIO AI for their professional media production team.
