# WIKIO AI vs Alveos

## Executive Summary

**Alveos** is a French Digital Asset Management (DAM) provider founded in the early 2000s, serving enterprise clients like Carrefour, Air France, and SFR. Their "Easy Library" product represents traditional DAM thinking: centralized file storage with basic search and permissions. With no visible product updates in recent years, no AI capabilities, and "formerly VC-backed" status indicating limited growth investment, Alveos represents the previous generation of media management.

**WIKIO AI** is a modern, AI-native collaboration platform built for how media teams work today. At transparent €60/user/month pricing, we provide intelligent search (3x faster retrieval), automated workflows (60% less duplicate work), and real-time collaboration—capabilities that didn't exist when Alveos was designed. We're not just a better DAM; we're the solution that makes traditional DAMs obsolete.

## The Generational Gap

**Alveos represents the old way**: Build a digital filing cabinet, add basic search, control who can access folders. This approach worked when organizations simply needed to replace physical photo libraries with digital ones. But it hasn't evolved for modern video-first workflows, AI-powered intelligence, or distributed team collaboration.

**WIKIO AI represents the modern standard**: AI understands your content semantically, teams collaborate in real-time across stakeholders, workflows automate repetitive tasks, and the platform adapts to how your team actually works—not how IT departments thought people should work 20 years ago.

## What Alveos Actually Offers

### Traditional DAM Capabilities

Alveos's "Easy Library" provides standard DAM functionality that was innovative... in 2005:

**File Storage & Organization:**

- Centralized photo/video/document storage
- Custom folder hierarchies
- Basic categorization by theme

**Access Control:**

- User permissions and roles
- GDPR compliance features
- Rights management for media usage

**Basic Search:**

- Keyword search through files
- Filtering by categories
- Manual tagging required

**Responsive Design:**

- Works on desktop, tablet, mobile
- (Note: This is now a baseline expectation, not a differentiator)

**Integration:**

- Works with their "EasyCreadoc" tool for campaign management
- Limited third-party integrations

### What's Missing (Everything Modern)

❌ **No AI capabilities** - No intelligent understanding of content\
❌ **No semantic search** - Can't find "scenes with celebrations" or "executives speaking"\
❌ **No automated workflows** - Manual processes for everything\
❌ **No real-time collaboration** - File sharing, not team workflows\
❌ **No video-specific features** - Built for photo libraries, not video production\
❌ **No content adaptation** - No multi-language, no format automation\
❌ **No modern UX** - Interface feels dated, requires training\
❌ **No innovation visible** - Most recent news: 2019 (SFR client announcement)

<Warning>
  **Reality Check**: Alveos is a maintenance-mode product. "Formerly VC-backed" means investors have exited, there's no growth capital, no innovation roadmap, and clients are locked into an aging system.
</Warning>

## Why Organizations Chose Alveos (Then)

### The Historical Context

In the 2000s-2010s, Alveos served a real need:

- **Digitization era**: Companies moving from physical archives to digital
- **Simple requirement**: "We need to store and find our marketing photos"
- **Limited options**: Few French DAM providers with enterprise compliance
- **Relationship selling**: Long sales cycles to IT departments, multi-year contracts

**Their client list tells the story**: Carrefour (retail), Air France (airline), SFR (telco), ADP (airports), Bolloré (logistics)—all traditional French enterprises with large, relatively static photo libraries for marketing materials.

### What Changed

**The world moved to video**: By 2020, video became primary content format. Alveos never adapted.

**Teams became distributed**: COVID accelerated remote work. Alveos's file-sharing model couldn't support real collaboration.

**AI became essential**: Semantic search, automated workflows, intelligent assistance—none of which Alveos offers.

**Performance expectations rose**: Modern users expect instant search, real-time updates, intuitive UX. Alveos delivers none of these.

**vs Alveos:**

## The Performance Problem

### Why Alveos Struggles

**Old Architecture:**

- Built on 2000s-era database technology
- Not designed for video-first workflows
- Performance degrades with library size
- Slow search, laggy interface

**No Optimization:**

- Video files treated like large photos
- No intelligent proxy workflows
- Heavy storage requirements
- Bandwidth-intensive operations

**Technical Debt:**

- Years of patches on aging codebase
- Difficult to add modern features
- No investment in modernization

**Reality**: Organizations with Alveos often hear "it's slow, but that's just how DAMs work." That's not true—it's how _old_ DAMs work.

✅ **Performance**: Expect instant search and real-time collaboration\
✅ **Budget**: Want transparent €60/user pricing\
✅ **Timeline**: Need to deploy in days, not months\
✅ **Scale**: 3 to 3,000+ users with same great experience\
✅ **Innovation**: Want platform that evolves with AI advances\
✅ **User experience**: Expect modern, intuitive interface

**Key value**: 3x faster search, 60% less duplicate work, 98% content adaptation savings

### Consider Alveos When:

⚠️ **Legacy commitment**: Already deeply integrated and can't migrate\
⚠️ **Static photo library**: Primarily managing marketing photos, not video\
⚠️ **French enterprise**: Need French vendor with enterprise compliance history\
⚠️ **Low expectations**: Accept slow performance and dated UX as "normal"\
⚠️ **IT-driven**: Purchase decisions made by IT, not actual users

<Warning>
  **Honest Assessment**: If you're evaluating Alveos, ask yourself: "Is this the best available technology, or am I being offered what's already implemented at my organization?" Most Alveos users didn't choose it—IT did, years ago.
</Warning>

## Migration from Alveos

### Why Teams Leave Alveos

Common frustrations driving migration:

**Performance Issues:**

- "Search takes forever with our growing library"
- "Video files make the system unusable"
- "Mobile experience is terrible"

**Missing Capabilities:**

- "We need video-specific workflows, not photo gallery"
- "No AI means endless manual tagging"
- "Can't collaborate—just share files"

**Stagnation:**

- "Nothing new in years"
- "Competitors have passed them by"
- "Locked into aging technology"

### WIKIO AI Migration Benefits

**Immediate Improvements:**

- 10x faster search (3 seconds vs 30+ seconds)
- Real collaboration vs file sharing
- Modern UX vs dated interface
- AI automation vs manual processes

**Long-term Value:**

- Platform that evolves with AI
- Transparent, scalable pricing
- Built for video-first workflows
- Active development and innovation

**Quick Migration:**

- Cloud-native: deploy in days
- Import existing assets
- Train teams in hours (intuitive UX)
- No expensive consulting required

## The Bottom Line

**Alveos is a cautionary tale**: A once-adequate DAM that stopped innovating. "Formerly VC-backed" tells you everything—investors exited because there's no growth story. Clients are trapped in multi-year contracts with a product that was outdated five years ago.

**WIKIO AI is the modern standard**: Built natively for AI, video, and distributed collaboration. We don't compete with Alveos because they're not really competitors—they're the past we're replacing.

**The choice isn't about features**: It's about working with modern tools that make your team faster, or being stuck with legacy systems that slow them down.

### Three Questions for Alveos Users:

1. **When was the last time Alveos released a meaningful update?** (Most can't remember)
2. **Does your team actually enjoy using it?** (Usually: "We tolerate it")
3. **Would you choose it today, knowing what's now available?** (Almost always: "No")

If you answered honestly, you know it's time to evaluate modern alternatives.
