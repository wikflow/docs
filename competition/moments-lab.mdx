# WIKIO AI vs Moments Lab

## Executive Summary

Moments Lab and WIKIO AI have an overlap from a functional perspective but a very different market positioning.

**Moments Lab** is an enterprise video discovery platform built for very large broadcasters (€40.3M raised, 58 employees). Their proprietary MXT-2 video model was a competitive advantage two years ago, but has become a strategic liability as open-source models now surpass their capabilities. With opaque enterprise pricing focused on \$100K+ deployments, they exclude small-to-mid-market organizations.

**WIKIO AI** is a modern, AI-native collaboration platform built on flexible architecture that rapidly integrates best-in-class AI models. With transparent pricing, we scale from €2K/year startups to €2M+ enterprise deployments, equally powerful for small teams and massive archives. Our modern UX and agile technical stack let us add new AI features in days, not quarters, while our pricing model grows with you instead of locking you out.

## The Strategic Difference

**Moments Lab's Challenge**: Their proprietary MXT-2 model, trained on 1.5B images, was defensible in 2023. Today, open-source video models evolve weekly and outperform proprietary solutions. Their technical architecture locks them into their own model, making it difficult to adopt superior alternatives.

**WIKIO AI's Advantage**: Our flexible architecture treats AI as a rapidly-evolving component, not a moat. We integrate the best models available (open-source or commercial) and can swap them as technology progresses. This architectural flexibility means new AI capabilities in days, not development cycles. We also combine different AIs to do a single tasks to take full advantage of what's best from each of them.

## Strategic Comparison

| Dimension              | WIKIO AI                                            | Moments Lab                                          |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Target Market**      | Scalable: €2K startups to €2M+ enterprises          | Large broadcasters only (\$100K+ minimum)            |
| **Core Strength**      | Daily collaboration workflows                       | Live event capture                                   |
| **Technical Strategy** | Flexible architecture, best-in-class AI integration | Proprietary video model (increasingly outdated)      |
| **Pricing**            | Transparent and scalable (from €2K  to €2M+)        | Custom enterprise (€100K+ deployments)               |
| **Archive Capability** | Equally powerful for any size library               | Built for massive archives and priced for large orgs |
| **AI Approach**        | Model-agnostic, rapid innovation                    | Locked into proprietary MXT-2                        |
| **User Experience**    | Modern, intuitive interface                         | Legacy broadcaster tooling                           |
| **Deployment**         | Instant cloud access                                | Probably relatively fast but not instant             |
| **Innovation Speed**   | New features in days                                | We expect monthly release cycles                     |

## Where Each Platform Wins

### Technical Architecture: Flexibility vs Lock-in

**WIKIO AI: Model-Agnostic Architecture**

Our flexible technical stack allows us to:

- **Integrate best-in-class AI models** as they emerge (GPT-4V, Gemini, Claude, open-source)
- **Ship new AI features in days**, not quarters
- **Swap models** when better alternatives appear
- **Avoid vendor lock-in** to any single AI provider
- **Stay current** with rapidly-evolving AI landscape

**Result**: Users always get the best available AI, not what was best 2 years ago.

**Moments Lab: Proprietary Model Lock-In**

Built around their MXT-2 proprietary model:

- **1.5B image training dataset** (announced March 2025)
- **Patented technology** creates switching costs
- **Architecture designed for their model**, hard to replace
- **Innovation tied to their R&D cycles**, not industry pace
- **Open-source models now outperform** in many video understanding tasks

**Result**: Customers locked into aging technology as the field accelerates past them.

<Warning>
  **The Innovator's Dilemma**: Moments Lab's proprietary model was their moat in 2023. In 2025, it's technical debt as open-source video models advance monthly.
</Warning>

### Live Events & Content Licensing

**Moments Lab Advantages:**

- **Live Asset Manager** captures hundreds of parallel streams
- **Sports and broadcast focus** (UEFA, World Rugby)
- **Content licensing marketplace** for monetization
- **Archive migration services** for legacy systems

**Not WIKIO AI's Focus**: We optimize for daily collaboration workflows, not live multi-stream capture or content licensing marketplaces. However, our search and archive capabilities are equally powerful regardless of library size.

<Info>
  **Archive Capability**: WIKIO AI handles massive video libraries just as effectively as Moments Lab. The difference is our focus on collaboration workflows vs their focus on live events and content licensing.

## Pricing & Market Access

### WIKIO AI: Transparent, Scalable Pricing

**€60/user/month** — Grows with you from startup to enterprise

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Small Team" icon="seedling">
    **3 users: ~€2K/year**

    Perfect for startups and small production teams testing AI workflows
  </Card>
  <Card title="Mid-Market" icon="building">
    **50 users: €36K/year**

    Full-featured collaboration for growing media organizations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enterprise" icon="city">
    **300+ users: €200K-€2M+**

    Enterprise scale with the same transparent per-user model
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Key Advantage**: Start small, scale infinitely. No artificial barriers, no forced enterprise minimums. The same powerful platform whether you have 3 users or 3,000.

### Moments Lab: Enterprise-Only Pricing

**Custom Pricing** — Opaque, high minimum commitment

- **Volume-based** (hours ingested, analyzed, stored)
- **Additional storage costs** (varies by volume)
- **Migration and implementation fees**
- **Minimum deployment**: ~\$100K+ annually
- **Pricing not disclosed** until enterprise sales process

<Warning>
  **Market Reality**: Moments Lab's pricing model creates high barriers to entry. Small and mid-market organizations are effectively excluded, even though the technology could serve them. This is a go-to-market choice, not a technical limitation.
</Warning>

**The Strategic Difference**:

- **WIKIO AI**: Democratized access—anyone can start at €2K/year and scale
- **Moments Lab**: Enterprise-only positioning—you need \$100K+ budget to get started

## Decision Framework

### Choose WIKIO AI When:

✅ **Budget**: €2K-€2M+ annual spend (transparent, scalable pricing)\
✅ **Need**: Daily collaboration workflows, not just search\
✅ **Timeline**: Need deployment in days, not months\
✅ **Tech philosophy**: Want flexibility to use best AI, not proprietary lock-in\
✅ **UX expectations**: Modern interface, not legacy broadcaster tools\
✅ **Team size**: Any size, from a solopreneur to 3,000+ users\
✅ **Market access**: Want to start small and scale, not forced enterprise minimum

**Key metrics**: 3x faster retrieval, 60% less duplicate work, 98% content adaptation savings

### Choose Moments Lab When:

✅ **Budget**: \$100K+ annual minimum deployment\
✅ **Live events**: Need multi-stream capture for sports/broadcast (this is their unique strength)\
✅ **Monetization**: Want content licensing marketplace\
✅ **Sales process**: Comfortable with opaque, custom enterprise pricing\
✅ **Technical team**: Have staff for complex implementation

**Unique use case**: Live sports/broadcast multi-stream capture

## The Bottom Line

**Pricing is the strategic differentiator**: Both platforms handle massive video libraries effectively. The difference is market access:

- **WIKIO AI**: Transparent pricing scales from €2K/year to €2M+ enterprises. Modern collaboration workflows with flexible AI architecture.
- **Moments Lab**: Opaque enterprise pricing with \$100K+ minimums. Built for live event capture with proprietary (aging) AI model.

**The architectural difference matters**: Moments Lab's proprietary model was defensible in 2023. In 2025, it's a liability as open-source video AI advances faster than any single company's R&D. WIKIO AI's flexible architecture means users get tomorrow's AI, not yesterday's.

**Different workflows, not different scale**:

- **"How do we collaborate better on daily content?"** → WIKIO AI's modern platform
- **"How do we capture 100 live sports streams simultaneously?"** → Moments Lab's Live Asset Manager
