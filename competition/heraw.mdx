title: 'WIKIO AI vs HERAW'
description: 'Comparing AI-native video intelligence with collaborative review workflows'
---

## Executive Summary

HERAW and WIKIO AI both serve the French media and production market but solve fundamentally different problems in the video workflow. **HERAW excels at collaborative review and approval** - bringing teams together to comment, validate, and manage projects. **WIKIO AI excels at intelligent discovery and automation** - helping teams find, understand, and adapt video content at scale.

**The key insight:** These aren't competing products. They address different workflow stages:
- **HERAW:** "How do we review and approve this video efficiently?"
- **WIKIO AI:** "How do we find the right footage and create localized versions automatically?"

For many organizations, both tools could coexist - HERAW for the validation phase, WIKIO AI for the discovery and adaptation phases.

<Info>
**Market Positioning:** HERAW has achieved impressive scale (200,000+ users, 190 countries) by focusing on the universal need for collaborative review. WIKIO AI targets a more specific pain point (video search and multilingual adaptation) but offers deeper AI capabilities in that domain.

## Target Audience & Use Cases

### When HERAW is the Right Choice

**Primary Users:**
- Production companies needing client review & approval
- Post-production teams managing multiple versions
- Marketing teams coordinating campaign assets
- Internal communications managing project workflows
- Agencies needing project management + review in one tool

**Perfect for:**
1. **Approval Bottlenecks:** When multiple stakeholders need to review and sign off on creative work
2. **Version Control:** When managing numerous iterations and need clear change history
3. **Project Coordination:** When you need task management, resource scheduling, and timeline tracking
4. **Tool Consolidation:** When using 5+ tools (Dropbox, Frame.io, Monday, etc.) and want to simplify
5. **Budget-Conscious Teams:** When €15/user is more realistic than €60/user for broad deployment

**Example Workflow:**
> A production agency creates a video campaign. Team uploads cuts to HERAW. Client reviews directly in platform with frame-accurate comments. Internal team sees all feedback in one place, makes revisions, uploads v2. Client compares versions side-by-side and approves final cut. Project manager tracks tasks through completion.

### When WIKIO AI is the Right Choice

**Primary Users:**
- News organizations with large video archives
- Media companies producing multilingual content
- Content creators adapting for multiple markets
- Production teams drowning in footage
- Organizations with inefficient video search

**Perfect for:**
1. **Search & Discovery:** When finding specific content in large libraries takes 30+ minutes
2. **Multilingual Content:** When localizing videos costs €800-2,500 per video
3. **Archive Monetization:** When valuable footage sits unused because no one can find it
4. **Content Repurposing:** When manually finding clips for highlights/compilations is too time-consuming
5. **Semantic Search Needs:** When keyword tagging doesn't capture what's actually in videos

**Example Workflow:**
> A news broadcaster searches "presidential candidate economic policy" and instantly finds all relevant clips across years of footage. Selects best moments, generates automated clip packages for social media. Adapts content for 5 European markets with AI-generated subtitles and voiceovers, maintaining cultural context. Total time: 2 hours instead of 3 days.

## Final Recommendation

**These platforms aren't direct competitors - they solve different problems:**

**HERAW is project management with video collaboration.** If your primary pain is coordinating teams, collecting stakeholder feedback, and managing approval workflows, HERAW delivers proven value at an accessible price point.

**WIKIO AI is AI-powered video intelligence.** If your primary pain is finding content in large archives, adapting videos for multiple languages, and automating repetitive production tasks, WIKIO AI offers capabilities HERAW can't match.

**The reality for many organizations:**
- **Small teams (5-20 people):** Choose one based on primary pain point
- **Medium teams (20-50 people):** Likely can afford only one; prioritize biggest pain
- **Large teams (50+ people):** Consider both - use WIKIO AI for archive search and adaptation, use HERAW for review and approval

**Budget-Constrained Decision:**
- If limited to €15/user budget → HERAW gives more value across broader team
- If can invest €60/user → WIKIO AI delivers deeper capabilities for specific high-value use cases

**Quick Decision Matrix:**

| Your Biggest Pain | Recommended Solution |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Can't find footage in archives | **WIKIO AI** |
| Multilingual adaptation is expensive | **WIKIO AI** |
| Review & approval is chaotic | **HERAW** |
| Managing projects & resources | **HERAW** |
| Need both search AND approval | **Both** (budget permitting) |
