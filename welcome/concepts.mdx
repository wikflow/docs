## User
A **user** is an individual interacting with Wikio. In the B2B context, every user belongs to an organization. Even solo users are tied to a company account for billing.

## Workspace
A **workspace** represents an organization. It includes billing details, a set of members and guests, and all projects, assets, and workflows for that company. The workspace receives invoices and manages subscriptions.

## Team
A **team** is a group of users collaborating on one or more projects. A user can belong to multiple teams. External collaborators can be invited and may affect billing.

## Project
A **project** moves from raw assets to release candidates to a master release in various formats. It holds the brief, timeline, many media files, and a linked client.

## Workflow
A **workflow** is a set of automated operations applied to media, such as transcription, subtitling, translation, detecting forbidden words, or suggesting scene cuts.
