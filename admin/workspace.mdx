## Overview

In Wikio, a **workspace** represents your entire organization. It contains all projects, teams, members, and assets linked to your company. We recommend keeping everything in a single workspace, as this matches the way Wikio is designed.

When you create a workspace, a default (invisible) team is also created automatically with the same name.

## Workspace settings

To open workspace settings, click your workspace name in the top-left corner and select **Settings**.

- **Members** see options related to projects, assets, and workflows.
- **Admins** see additional administration tools for managing billing, permissions, and integrations.

## Administration settings (admins only)

Admins can:

- Update the workspace name and URL.
- Manage login and invitation preferences.
- Add or remove members and guests.
- View and update billing details and plans.
- Import or export projects and assets.
- Enable or disable features such as public collections or workflows.
- Manage integrations with third-party services (e.g., storage providers, collaboration tools, publishing platforms).
- Delete the workspace (note: this permanently removes all data and cannot be undone).

## Member-level actions

Admins and members (with permissions) can:

- Create and manage labels.
- Define custom project statuses.
- Use workspace-level templates for projects and assets.
- Add custom emojis and visual tags.
- Configure integrations if they have authorization from the connected service.

## Multiple workspaces

At this time, **Wikio only supports one workspace per account**. This ensures all projects, assets, and workflows stay together under the same organization.

Support for **multiple workspaces** is part of our product roadmap, and when available, each workspace will have:

- Its own member list and permissions.
- Separate billing and plans.
- Independent integrations and settings.

For now, if you want to work with more than one organization, you can:

- Be invited as a **guest member** to another company's workspace.
- Use different accounts with separate email addresses.
