## How our plans and billing work

### Plans

Plans define which features and workflows are available in your workspace.\
Check the **Pricing page** for the most up-to-date information.

### Billing

Billing applies at the **workspace level**. The organization that owns the workspace receives the invoice and must pay for active members.

- Charges are based on the number of unsuspended users (admins, members, and guests with access).
- You can choose between **monthly** and **yearly** billing.
- Your account is charged monthly for the number of users in your workspace.
- Adding users mid-month does not trigger an immediate charge; they will appear on the next invoice.
- Removing users mid-month does not generate a credit for the remainder of that cycle.

Wikio also supports usage-based **credits** (for workflows such as transcription or translation).

## Manage your billing

Navigate to **Settings \> Administration \> Billing** to access your plan information and make updates.\
From here, you can:

- View or change your plan
- Update payment details (credit card, billing address)
- Update the billing email
- View billing history: past invoices and charges
- See if any charge is failed or overdue

## Change or cancel a subscription

Workspace admins can change or cancel a subscription under **Settings \> Administration \> Plans**.

- Changes take effect at the end of the billing period (end of month for monthly plans, end of year for annual).
- We do not provide partial refunds for mid-cycle cancellations.
- If you are not ready to commit to an annual plan, start monthly. You can upgrade to annual later to access discounted rates.

When cancelling a paid plan:

- Projects, assets, and users are deleted after 15 days

## Add a VAT number

To add a VAT number:

- During upgrade: select **“I’m purchasing as a business”** on the checkout page.
- For existing subscriptions: go to **Settings \> Administration \> Billing \> Billing details \> Edit**.

## Taxes

Depending on your billing address, taxes may apply. The billing address you provide determines whether VAT or sales tax is applied and at what rate.

## Important notes

- Plans apply to a single workspace. If your company operates multiple workspaces in the future, each will require its own subscription.
- Invite external collaborators carefully, as they also count towards billing.
