  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">

</Callout>

## Who can invite

- Workspace owners and admins can invite new members by default  
- Owners can restrict who can invite from **Settings → Administration → Members → Permissions**  
- Learn how adding or removing members affects billing in [Billing and plans](/admin/billing)

## Approved email domains

Let people with your company domain join without a manual invite.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Security">
    Go to **Settings → Administration → Security**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add allowed domain">
    Add one or more domains, for example **example.com**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    People who sign up with a matching address can join the workspace directly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Notes

- This streamlines joining but does not stop users from creating separate workspaces with the same domain  
- Review the domain list regularly to keep it up to date  
- If you transfer or retire a domain, remove it from the allowed list to prevent unwanted access

## Invite link

Generate a unique link that lets people join without entering emails one by one.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Security">
    Go to **Settings → Administration → Security**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate link">
    Create an invite link and copy it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share carefully">
    Share the link only inside your organization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Disable when done">
    You can revoke the link at any time from the same screen.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Invite and assign

You can prepare access for invitees before they accept.

- Set them as reviewers on selected items  
- Subscribe them to workflows so they receive task updates  
- Add them to notification rules for assets they will follow

After they join, their assignments and subscriptions are active.

## Manage members

From **Settings → Administration → Members** you can:

- Change a member role  
- Remove a member  
- Resend an invitation  
- Filter by status: active, pending, suspended

## Troubleshooting

- **Invite not received**  
  Ask the invitee to check spam or quarantine and allow emails from **wikio.ai**  
- **Invite link shared too widely**  
  Revoke the link and generate a new one, then review recent joins  
- **Cannot invite**  
  You may not have permission to invite. Contact a workspace owner or admin
