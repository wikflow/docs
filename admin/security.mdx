Wikio is built with enterprise-grade security so your media and data stay protected. This page covers how Wikio handles data protection, access controls, and compliance.

## Data protection

All data is protected in transit and at rest.

| Layer | Detail |
|---|---|
| **In transit** | TLS 1.2+ encryption for all connections between your browser and Wikio servers |
| **At rest** | AES-256 encryption for stored files and database records |
| **Hosting** | Infrastructure hosted in EU data centers with SOC 2 certified providers |
| **Backups** | Automated daily backups with geo-redundant storage |

<Callout type="info">
Media files are stored in isolated, workspace-specific storage buckets. No other workspace can access your files.
</Callout>

## Access controls

Wikio uses a layered permission model to ensure people see only what they need.

- **Workspace roles**: Owner, Admin, Member, and Guest—each with increasing restrictions. See [Members](/admin/members) for details.
- **Team roles**: Team Admin, Editor, Reviewer, and Viewer control access within a team. See [Teams](/concepts/team).
- **Item-level permissions**: Individual projects, assets, and collections can have their own sharing settings. See [Sharing & permissions](/features/sharing).

Permissions are enforced on every API call, not just in the UI.

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

Enterprise workspaces can enable SSO so members authenticate through your identity provider.

1. Go to **Settings > Security > SSO**.
2. Choose your provider (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, or any SAML 2.0 / OIDC provider).
3. Enter the required configuration details (Entity ID, SSO URL, certificate).
4. Enable SSO and optionally enforce it for all members.

<Callout type="info">
When SSO is enforced, members must sign in through your identity provider. Password-based login is disabled for all non-owner accounts.
</Callout>

## Audit logs

Audit logs record key actions across your workspace so you can track who did what and when.

Logged events include:

- Member invitations and removals
- Permission changes on projects, assets, and collections
- Asset uploads, downloads, and deletions
- Workspace and team settings changes
- SSO configuration changes

Access audit logs from **Settings > Security > Audit logs**. Filter by user, action type, or date range. Logs are retained for 12 months.

## Sharing policies

Admins can control how content is shared outside the workspace.

- **Disable public links**: Prevent anyone from creating "Anyone with link" shares. Go to **Settings > Security > Sharing** and turn off public links.
- **Restrict guest invitations**: Limit who can invite external guests, or disable guest access entirely.
- **Require approval**: Optionally require admin approval before content is shared externally.

See [Sharing & permissions](/features/sharing) for how sharing works at the item level.

## Compliance

Wikio maintains compliance certifications and follows industry standards for data handling.

| Standard | Status |
|---|---|
| **SOC 2 Type II** | Certified—covers security, availability, and confidentiality |
| **GDPR** | Compliant—EU data hosting, DPA available on request |
| **ISO 27001** | In progress |

For a copy of our SOC 2 report or to sign a Data Processing Agreement, contact [security@wikio.ai](mailto:security@wikio.ai).

## Data retention and deletion

- **Active data**: Stored as long as your workspace is active.
- **Deleted assets**: Moved to trash and permanently deleted after 30 days.
- **Account deletion**: Request full account and data deletion by contacting support. All data is purged within 30 days of the request.
- **Workspace closure**: When a workspace is closed, all associated data is deleted within 30 days.

<Callout type="warning">
Permanent deletion is irreversible. Export any data you need before closing a workspace or emptying the trash.
</Callout>

## Best practices

- **Enable SSO**: Centralizes authentication and reduces the risk of compromised passwords.
- **Review permissions regularly**: Audit team membership and sharing settings quarterly.
- **Use the principle of least privilege**: Give users the minimum access they need to do their work.
- **Monitor audit logs**: Check logs periodically for unexpected access patterns or configuration changes.
- **Disable public links for sensitive workspaces**: If your content is confidential, turn off "Anyone with link" sharing.
