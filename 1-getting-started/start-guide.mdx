Wikio is designed to help creative teams and organizations handle media at scale. Whether you are producing films, managing marketing campaigns, or archiving large video libraries, Wikio provides a simple and powerful workspace built around your media workflows.

This guide gives you the essentials to start using Wikio so you can focus on what matters most: producing, repurposing, and publishing high-quality content.

## Intro to Wikio

Begin with an overview of the platform by watching our **Intro to Wikio** video. It highlights the structure of a workspace, how projects are organized, and the basics of using AI workflows to transform your assets.

## Demo instance

To get a feel for the platform, try our **demo environment**. You can explore the navigation, upload sample files, and run test workflows directly in your browser. All changes are temporary and will reset when you refresh. (Note: in the demo, billing and advanced settings are not available.)

## Onboarding sessions

We host live onboarding sessions where you can see common workflows in action, such as transcription, subtitling, or creating a master release from raw video files. These sessions are interactive, so you can ask questions and see how teams use Wikio in real projects.

## Learning library

Our **video library** contains short tutorials covering frequent use cases: organizing assets, creating projects, setting up workflows, and publishing collections. 

These are practical step-by-step guides you can revisit anytime.

## Setting up Wikio for your company

After your first look, itâ€™s time to set up Wikio for your organization. The easiest way is to create a workspace using your company email.

Once inside your workspace, you can explore our dedicated onboarding paths:

- **For admins**: how to set up billing, permissions, and company settings.
- **For small teams**: using Wikio to collaborate on a few projects.
- **For studios and growing companies**: managing large archives and scaling workflows.
- **For team members**: tips for joining an existing workspace and navigating assets and projects.

## Examples and case studies

It helps to see how others are working with Wikio. We regularly share examples from media companies, brands, and independent studios:

- How a broadcaster organizes its video archive.
- How a brand repurposes long-form footage into social content.
- How documentary producers use AI workflows for subtitles and translations.
