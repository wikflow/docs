Wikio is organized around a set of core concepts. Understanding these will help you navigate the platform and structure your work effectively.

## User
A **user** is an individual interacting with Wikio.  
In the B2B context, every user belongs to an organization. Even solo users are tied to a company account for billing purposes.

## Workspace
A **workspace** represents an organization. It includes:  
- Company billing details (VAT ID, address, payment information)  
- A set of members and guests  
- All projects, assets, and workflows belonging to the organization  

The workspace is the entity that receives invoices and manages subscriptions.

## Team
A **team** is a group of users collaborating on one or more projects.  
- A user can belong to multiple teams.  
- External collaborators can be invited, which may impact billing.  

## Project
A **project** is the main unit of production.  
Projects typically move from:  
1. **Raw assets** (rushes, footage)  
2. **Release candidates** (draft versions)  
3. **Master release** (final video, in multiple formats for TV, web, or social)  

Each project contains:  
- A project brief  
- A timeline  
- Potentially thousands of media files  
- An associated client (internal or external)  

## Client
A **client** is the external party that commissions or receives the final project deliverable.  

## Item (Asset)
An **item** (or asset) is a raw media file such as video footage.  
- Items usually belong to one project but can be reused across projects.  
- Once published, items become searchable and available for analytics.  

## Workflow
A **workflow** is a sequence of automated operations applied to media. Examples:  
- Transcription  
- Subtitling  
- Translation  
- Detecting forbidden words  
- Suggesting scene cuts for time limits  

## Folders
**Folders** can be used to automate recurring workflows.  
- Files dropped into an input folder are processed automatically.  
- Results appear in the output folder.  
- APIs are available for deeper integration.  

## Collections
**Collections** are shared video libraries defined at the workspace level.  
- They can be made visible to all members, e.g., for training purposes.  
- Collections are searchable with AI-generated tags (e.g., “leadership under pressure,” “ERP setup”).
