# Getting started with Wikio

Learn the main concepts in Wikio so you can set up your organization and find your way around quickly.

## Core concepts

### Workspace

A **workspace** in Wikio represents your company or organization. This is where all projects, teams, members, and media assets are stored.

Each workspace has its own address, and logging in always connects you to one specific workspace. The workspace holds:

- Company information for billing (legal name, company address, VAT number, payment details).
- A list of members and guests with different permission levels.
- All creative work, files, and workflows belonging to the company.

### Teams

A **team** is a group of people who collaborate on the same projects. A person can be part of more than one team, and you may also invite external collaborators if needed.

Teams make it easier to structure work, share files, and assign responsibilities. The basic version of Wikio does not have Teams enabled. 

### Projects

A **project** is the main unit of production in Wikio. Projects are often built around creating a finished video, for example: a documentary, a TV spot, or a social media clip.

Inside a project you can:

- Upload and organize raw footage.
- Attach briefs, schedules, and clients.
- Work through multiple draft versions (release candidates).
- Produce the final master version in the right formats for distribution.

Projects can be managed internally or linked to external clients.

### Assets (Items)

An **asset, or raw asset, or item** is a piece of raw media, usually a video file. Items are typically connected to one project but can also be reused in other projects.

Wikio allows you to:

- Add metadata and tags automatically.
- Run workflows such as transcription or subtitling.

### Video

A video can be :

- Publish items to make them searchable and track their performance.

### Workflows

A **workflow** is a chain of actions that transforms or analyzes media. Examples include:

- Converting speech to text.
- Generating subtitles.
- Translating videos.
- Checking for forbidden words.
- Suggesting scene cuts to fit specific time limits.

Workflows can run manually, through automation with folders, or via API integration.

### Collections

Workspaces can publish **collections** of assets for company-wide access. For example, a training collection with tagged videos that everyone can search. Wikio’s AI helps organize these with relevant tags so users can quickly find useful segments.

## Organizing work

### Folders

Folders can be set up to handle recurring workflows. For example, placing files into an input folder triggers automatic subtitling, and the results appear in the output folder.

## Navigation and actions

### Quick actions

With **Quick Actions** (Ctrl or Cmd \+ K), you can instantly perform tasks without leaving the page. For example:

- Add tags.
- Move assets into a project.
- Apply a workflow.
- Assign a collaborator.

### Bulk actions

Select multiple assets or projects to update them at once. For instance, apply a workflow to many files or move a batch of assets to a new team.

### Undo

Most changes can be reverted quickly with the undo command (Ctrl or Cmd \+ Z).

## Views and dashboards

Wikio gives you several standard views:

- **Homepage**: your main dashboard.
- **Assets**: browse and search uploaded media.
- **Projects**: see all projects and their progress.
- **Teams**: overview of active teams.
- **Members**: a list of users in your organization.
- **Search history**: revisit past searches.
- **Notifications**: updates on shared work.

Custom views can also be created by applying filters, such as “assets awaiting subtitles” or “projects for Client A.”

## Settings

There are two main areas in settings:

- **Account**: personal preferences.
- **Administration**: organization-wide options including billing, plans, and user management.
