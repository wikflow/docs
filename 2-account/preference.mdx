Adjust your preferences in Wikio to make your workspace faster, easier to use, and better suited to the way you work.

## General settings

### Default home screen

Choose what you see first when you log into Wikio. By default, youâ€™ll land on the **Homepage**, but you can set this to any of the following:

- Homepage (overview)
- All assets
- Active projects
- Search history
- My projects

### Display names

Decide whether you prefer to see team members by their full names or their chosen usernames.

### First day of the week

Set how calendars should display weeks to match your preference.

### Text and emoji

Enable a toggle to automatically convert text emoticons into emojis while writing notes or comments.

## Interface and theme

- Adjust font size and pointer style.
- Switch between light and dark modes, or use your system settings to change automatically.
- Build a custom theme for your workspace or choose from a set of presets.

## Automations and workflows

### Auto-assignment

You can choose to automatically assign new projects or uploaded assets to yourself. This is useful if you are the main person managing those files.

### Workflow shortcuts

Enable automatic actions to speed up repetitive steps, for example:

- When you upload a new item, automatically apply a workflow (e.g., transcription).
- When you create a new project, auto-assign yourself as project owner.
