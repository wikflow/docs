## Overview

Your profile, found under **Settings \> Account \> Profile**, is where you set up how other members in your Wikio workspace will recognize you.

## Profile picture

By default, your profile shows your initials. To personalize it, hover over the avatar until the edit icon appears and click it. A file selector will open so you can upload a photo.

Once you’ve added a photo, you can always replace it with a new one, but you can’t revert back to having no picture.

## Name and username

You can update your name and choose how it is displayed to other members. Depending on preferences, some users may see your full name, while others may prefer usernames. You can adjust these options in **Settings \> Account \> Preferences**.

## Email address

Your email address is the identifier for your Wikio account across all workspaces.

For example:

- If you join **Workspace A** with [jane.doe@email.com](mailto:jane.doe@email.com), a user is created for that workspace.
- If you later join **Workspace B** with the same address, you appear there as well.
- If you update your email, it updates for all workspaces linked to that account.

### Changing your email

1. Go to **Settings \> Account \> Profile**.
2. Hover over your email and click the edit icon.
3. Enter the new address in the pop-up and confirm.
4. You’ll receive confirmation emails at both the old and new addresses. Approve both to complete the change.

This update applies across all workspaces tied to your account. If you want to use a new address only for one workspace, the recommended method is to invite the new address as a member and remove the old one.

If your company is changing domains, contact [**support@wikio.ai**](mailto:support@wikio.ai) with the current and new domains so we can assist in updating all users at once.

## Personal integrations

Each user can connect their own integrations (e.g., cloud storage, publishing platforms, or editing tools). These are tied to your personal account, so actions taken through the integration are linked back to you. You can manage or disconnect these from your profile settings.

## Leaving a workspace

If you want to leave a workspace:

- Go to **Settings \> Profile** and select **Leave workspace**.
- Once you leave, you no longer have access to the workspace’s projects, assets, or collections.
- To regain access, an admin will need to re-invite or reactivate your account.
