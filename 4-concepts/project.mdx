**Project details**

- Project name
- Final video length (this is needed for the video editor),
- Video format
- Project ETA (time to deliver the project)

**Input**

- media content, i.e. the raw footages / rush. There could be a mix of photos and videos, while we should expect seeing way more videos than photos.
- a project brief, i.e. text explaining what the project is about. This is likely to be instructions to the video editor professional
- a detailed script, which could be written by either the owner or the video editor
- other relevant content such as brand design guidelines (this will be useful for brands to have this automatically shared instead of constantly sharing it with all their third parties)

Please note that some project such as dubbing project may have a single input, a single file to be dubbed. It is still a project with a number of version and a Master Release.

**Master Release:** There is a Master Release with potentially multiple formats (resolution or format for different socials). To arrive at this result, there will be a lot of inputs that will include potentially hundreds or even thousands of files.

**Versions**: Before getting to the Master Release, there will be a number of versions, Release candidates. All the versions should be made easily accessible.

**Working members:** A project can be worked on by multiple teams (like content creators, publishers, editors, reviewers). We shall make it very easy for members of a team to upload items on a given project (from the web and mobile, from cameras etc…).

The most common case might just be two individuals: the owner of the content, i.e. the one that will publish and the video editor who will do the work.

A project belongs to a single organization. It’s likely that most of the teams are also from the organization but not necessarily.
