# Introduction

There are multiple ways to run a workflow. You can decide to start with the workflow you want to run and select the asset, or select an asset first and run the workflow on it.

# Workflows

### Empty state

When there is no workflow, we have an empty state screen

# Create workflow

## Create a new workflow

A workflow should be a series of nodes - ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

Trigger :

- Associated to an address (a particular URL?)
- Upload a file to an Input Folder (a new concept - this should be made visible on the Home page of a particular Workspace)

Input and Output

- What is the Input (type of content)
- What is the Output

Operation store (like an AppStore of Operation)

- Transcribe
- Translate

Destination of Output

- Posting the result somewhere?
- Emailing someone following the process

# Workflow post upload

- The user logs-in and see the Homepage with a big (upload and start work)
- The user uploads a file to work on it.
- When the uploads is completed, the user can click on it, to see the file and then decide to run a workflow on it.
- As part of the workflow configuration, the user is asked about the “Project” and if the Project is new, the Client to which this project is related.
- The user decides the kind of workflow he wants to run, on a list of workflow. There are some default ones, and specific ones, created by the user himself.
- When the workflow is launched, the ETA is provided to the end-user
- When the workflow is completed, the end-user receives a notification.
- The user can then verify the work, and send the result to the client for review.
