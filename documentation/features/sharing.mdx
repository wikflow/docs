WIKIO AI makes it easy to share your work with the right people at the right time. Whether you're collaborating with teammates, getting feedback from clients, or presenting to stakeholders, our flexible sharing options keep you in control.

## Sharing overview

In WIKIO AI, you can share content at different levels:

- **Individual assets** — Share a single video, image, or file
- **Collections** — Share a curated group of assets
- **Projects** — Give access to an entire project workspace

Each sharing method gives you granular control over what recipients can see and do.

## Share an asset

To share an individual asset:

1. Open the asset you want to share
2. Click the **Share** button in the top-right corner
3. Choose how you want to share:
   - **Add people** — Invite specific users by email
   - **Copy link** — Generate a shareable link
4. Set the appropriate permissions
5. Click **Share** to send the invitation or copy the link

<Tip>
When you share via link, you can track who has viewed your content and when they accessed it.
</Tip>

## Share a collection

Collections let you group related assets and share them together:

1. Navigate to your collection
2. Click **Share** in the collection header
3. Add collaborators by email or generate a link
4. Configure collection-level permissions
5. Confirm sharing

Recipients will see all assets in the collection based on their permission level.

## Share a project

Project sharing gives access to the full project workspace:

1. Open the project settings
2. Go to the **Members** tab
3. Click **Invite members**
4. Enter email addresses and assign roles
5. Send invitations

<Note>
Project members inherit access to all assets within the project unless you configure specific restrictions.

## Workspace roles

In addition to asset-level permissions, WIKIO AI uses workspace roles to define what users can do across your organization:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Owner" icon="crown">
    Manages billing, workspace settings, and can transfer ownership. One per workspace.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Admin" icon="user-shield">
    Creates teams, manages members, views audit logs, and handles workflow templates.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Member" icon="user">
    Standard internal collaborator who can create projects, upload assets, and invite others.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Guest" icon="user-clock">
    External collaborator with project-limited access. Cannot invite others or manage settings.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Viewer role

**Viewers** receive link-based access without needing to log in. They're identified by their email address via a unique link. If a Viewer creates an account, they can request promotion to Guest or Member.

<Info>
Owners can disable Guest access at the workspace level if your organization requires all collaborators to be full members.
</Info>
