description: "How WIKIO AI collects, uses, and protects your personal data"
---

This Privacy Policy describes how WIKIO AI collects, uses, and discloses information associated with an identified or identifiable individual (referred to in this Privacy Policy as "Personal Data") and what choices you have around this activity. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.

When we refer to "WIKIO AI", "we", "us", or "our", we mean WIKIOAI SAS, as explained in more detail in the [Identifying the Data Controller and Processor](#identifying-controller-processor) section below.

## Applicability of This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to WIKIO AI's artificial intelligence platform, including our web application, API services (collectively, the "Services"), wikio.ai and other WIKIO AI websites (collectively, the "Websites"), and other interactions (e.g., customer service inquiries, user conferences, etc.) you may have with WIKIO AI. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, then do not access or use the Services, Websites or any other aspect of WIKIO AI's business. For the avoidance of doubt, this is the only privacy policy that applies to WIKIO AI.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party applications, AI models, or software that integrate with the Services through the WIKIO AI platform ("Third-Party Services"), or any other third-party products, services or businesses who will provide their services under their own terms of service and privacy policy. In addition, a separate agreement governs delivery, access and use of the Services (the "Customer Agreement"), including the processing of data such as prompts, documents, files, or other content submitted through Services accounts (collectively, "Customer Data"). The organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person) that entered into the Customer Agreement ("Customer") controls its instance of the Services (its "Workspace") and any associated Customer Data. If you have any questions about specific Workspace settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer whose Workspace you use. If you have an account, you can check your account settings for the contact information of your Workspace owner(s) and administrator(s). If you have received an invitation to join a Workspace but have not yet created an account, you should request assistance from the Customer that sent the invitation.

## Information We Collect And Receive

WIKIO AI will collect and receive information through operating the Services and Websites, and through other interactions with WIKIO AI. Such information will include Customer Data and other information and data ("Other Information") in a variety of ways:

### Customer Data

Customers or individuals granted access to a Workspace by a Customer ("Authorized Users") routinely submit Customer Data to WIKIO AI when using the Services. Customer Data includes:

- **AI Prompts and Queries**: Text inputs, questions, and instructions provided to our AI systems
- **Documents and Files**: Documents, videos, images, and other files uploaded for analysis or processing
- **Generated Content**: AI-generated images, videos, files such as subtitles or transcript, summaries, analyses, and other outputs created through the Services
- **Conversation History**: Chat logs and interaction history with AI assistants, as well as interaction between users in order to complete a task
- **Training Data**: Custom data provided to fine-tune or train AI models (when applicable)
- **Annotations and Feedback**: Corrections, ratings, and feedback provided on AI outputs

### Other Information

WIKIO AI also collects, generates and/or receives the following categories of Other Information:

#### Workspace and Account Information

To create or update a Workspace account, you or our Customer (e.g. your employer) supply WIKIO AI with an email address, password, company domain, and/or other account setup details. In addition, Customers that purchase a paid version of the Services provide WIKIO AI (or its payment processors) with billing details such as credit card information, banking information, and/or a billing address.

#### Usage Information

**Services Metadata** When an Authorized User interacts with the Services, metadata is generated that provides additional context about the way that an Authorized User uses the Services. For example, WIKIO AI logs the Workspaces, AI models used, features accessed, API endpoints called, and what Third-Party Services are used (if any).

**Log Data** As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our servers automatically collect information when you access or use our Websites or Services and record it in log files. This log data may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page you visited before using the Website or Services, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, and your language preferences.

**Device Information** WIKIO AI collects information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this Other Information often depends on the type of device used and its settings.

**Location Information** We receive information from you, our Customers and other third-parties that helps us approximate your location. We may, for example, use a business address submitted by your employer (who is our Customer) or an IP address received from your browser or device to determine approximate location to assist with localization or for security purposes.

#### Cookie Information

WIKIO AI uses a variety of cookies and similar technologies in our Websites and Services to help us collect Other Information. For more details about how we use these technologies, and your opt-out controls and other options, please visit our Cookie Policy.

#### Third-Party Services Information

A Customer can choose to permit or restrict Third-Party Services for its Workspace and WIKIO AI can receive personal data from such Third-Party Services. Typically, Third-Party Services are software, AI models, or data sources that integrate with our Services, and a Customer can permit its Authorized Users to enable and disable these integrations for its Workspace. WIKIO AI may also develop and offer applications that connect the Services with a Third-Party Service.

Once enabled, the provider of a Third-Party Service may share certain information with WIKIO AI. For example, if a file storage application is enabled to permit videos to be imported to a Workspace, we may receive the user name and email address of Authorized Users, along with additional information that the application makes available to WIKIO AI to facilitate the integration. Authorized Users should check the privacy settings and notices in these Third-Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to WIKIO AI.

We do not, however, receive or store passwords for any of these Third-Party Services when connecting them to the Services.

#### AI Model Information

WIKIO AI collects information about your usage of AI models, including:

- Model selection and switching patterns
- Token usage and API consumption
- Model performance metrics and error rates
- Feature usage (e.g., video search, transcript generation, photo analysis, video sequence generation)

#### Contact Information

In accordance with the consent process provided by your device or other third-party API, any contact information that an Authorized User chooses to import, forward or upload to the Services is collected when using the Services.

#### Third-Party Data

WIKIO AI may receive data about organizations, industries, lists of companies that are customers, Website visitors, marketing campaigns and other matters related to our business from parent corporation(s), affiliates and subsidiaries, our partners, or others that we use to make our own information better or more useful. This data may be combined with Other Information we collect and might include aggregate-level data, such as which IP addresses correspond to zip codes or countries.

#### Additional Information Provided to WIKIO AI

We also receive Other Information when submitted to our Websites or in other ways, such as responses or opinions you provide if you participate in a focus group, contest, activity or event, feedback you provide about our products or services, information you provide if you apply for a job with WIKIO AI, request support, interact with our social media accounts or otherwise communicate with WIKIO AI.

<Note>
  Generally, no one is under a statutory or contractual obligation to provide any Customer Data or Other Information (collectively, "Information"). However, certain Information is collected automatically and, if some Information, such as Workspace setup details, is not provided, we may be unable to provide the Services.
</Note>
