Collections let you group related assets into curated sets without moving files out of their projects. Use them to build reels, prepare review packages, or organize content by theme.

## Create a collection

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Collections section">
    Click **Collections** in the sidebar or navigate to your library and select the **Collections** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new collection">
    Click **New collection**, enter a name and optional description, then click **Create**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add assets">
    Browse your library or projects and select the assets you want to include. Click **Add to collection** and choose your collection.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
Adding an asset to a collection does not move or copy the file. The asset stays in its original project and appears in the collection as a reference.
</Callout>

## Add and remove assets

You can manage collection contents at any time.

- **Add assets**: Open the collection, click **Add**, and select assets from your library. You can also right-click any asset and choose **Add to collection**.
- **Remove assets**: Inside the collection, select an asset and click **Remove**. This removes it from the collection only—the original file is not deleted.
- **Bulk actions**: Select multiple assets to add or remove them in one step.

## Organize collections

### Nesting

Collections can be nested inside other collections to create a hierarchy. Drag a collection onto another to make it a sub-collection.

### Reordering

Drag assets within a collection to set a custom order. This order is preserved when you share the collection or switch between views.

### Rename or describe

Click the collection title to rename it, or open **Settings** to update the description. A clear name and description help teammates find the right collection quickly.

## Share a collection

Collections use the same sharing controls as projects and assets.

1. Open the collection and click **Share**.
2. Invite workspace members, teams, or external guests.
3. Choose a permission level: **Full access**, **Can edit**, **Can comment**, or **Can view**.

Recipients see the collection in their **Shared with me** section. See [Sharing & permissions](/features/sharing) for details.

<Callout type="warning">
Sharing a collection grants access to all assets inside it. Verify the contents before sharing with external guests.
</Callout>

## Collection views

Switch between views depending on how you want to browse:

- **Grid view**: Visual thumbnails—best for reviewing video and image assets.
- **List view**: Compact rows with metadata—best for sorting by name, date, or duration.

Toggle views using the icons in the top-right corner of the collection.

## Best practices

- **Name collections descriptively**: Use names like "Q1 Campaign Finals" or "Client Review — March" so the purpose is clear.
- **Keep collections focused**: A collection with too many unrelated assets becomes hard to navigate. Create multiple collections instead.
- **Use for review cycles**: Build a collection of assets that need feedback, share it with reviewers, and track comments in one place.
- **Clean up after delivery**: Archive or delete collections once a project wraps so your workspace stays organized.
