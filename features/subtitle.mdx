Subtitles make your videos accessible and searchable. Wikio generates subtitles automatically using AI transcription and lets you edit, translate, and export them in standard formats.

## Generate subtitles

Wikio can create subtitles from any video with spoken audio.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select an asset">
    Open the video you want to subtitle from your library or project.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the subtitle workflow">
    Click **Workflows** and choose **Generate subtitles**. Select the spoken language if Wikio doesn't detect it automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the result">
    Once processing completes, subtitles appear in the timeline below the video player. Each segment shows the text and its timecode.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
Processing time depends on video length. You'll receive a notification when subtitles are ready.
</Callout>

## Edit subtitles

Click any subtitle segment to edit its text. Changes save automatically.

- **Split a segment**: Place the playhead where you want to divide, then click the split icon.
- **Merge segments**: Select two adjacent segments and click merge.
- **Adjust timing**: Drag the segment edges in the timeline or edit the timecode directly.
- **Delete a segment**: Select it and press <kbd>Delete</kbd> or use the context menu.

<Callout type="warning">
Editing subtitles does not alter the original video file. Subtitles are stored separately and applied during playback or export.
</Callout>

## Translate subtitles

Wikio can translate your subtitles into multiple languages.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open subtitle settings">
    With subtitles visible, click the **Languages** dropdown above the timeline.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a language">
    Select **Add translation** and choose the target language.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and refine">
    AI translation runs automatically. Review the translated segments and make adjustments where needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You can maintain multiple language tracks for a single video. Viewers choose their preferred language in the player.

## Sync adjustments

If subtitles drift out of sync, use the player's offset controls:

- <kbd>⌥ Alt</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd> shifts subtitles earlier by 50 ms
- <kbd>⌥ Alt</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> shifts subtitles later by 50 ms

For larger corrections, select all segments and drag them together in the timeline.

## Export subtitles

Export subtitles for use in other platforms or for archival.

1. Click **Export** in the subtitle panel.
2. Choose a format:

| Format | Use case |
|---|---|
| **SRT** | Most video players and platforms (YouTube, Vimeo) |
| **VTT** | Web players and HTML5 video |
| **STL** | Broadcast and professional workflows |
| **Plain text** | Transcripts without timecodes |

3. Click **Download** to save the file.

## Burn-in subtitles

To permanently embed subtitles into the video:

1. Open the **Export** menu on the video asset.
2. Enable **Burn-in subtitles** and select the language track.
3. Choose your output format and resolution.
4. Export the video.

Burned-in subtitles cannot be turned off during playback but ensure compatibility with any player.

## Best practices

- **Review AI output**: Automated transcription handles most speech well, but review names, technical terms, and accents.
- **Keep segments short**: Aim for one to two lines per segment so viewers can read comfortably.
- **Use consistent styling**: If you customize fonts or colors, apply the same style across all videos for brand consistency.
- **Translate early in the workflow**: Adding translations before client review lets stakeholders approve all language versions together.

## Troubleshooting

- **Subtitles not generating**: Ensure the video has audible speech. Silent or music-only videos won't produce results.
- **Poor transcription accuracy**: Check that you selected the correct spoken language. Background noise can also affect quality.
- **Sync issues after export**: Verify the export frame rate matches the original video.
