## Introduction

In Wikio, you can share projects, assets, and collections with teammates, clients, or external collaborators. Sharing controls let you decide **who can access** and **what they can do**.

---

## Share a collection or asset

1. Select `Share` at the top of a collection or asset.
2. Enter the names or emails of the people you want to invite.
   - If they’re already part of your workspace, you’ll see them in the list to select from
   - You can also invite external users as **guests** by entering their email.
3. Choose a **permission level** from the dropdown.
4. Click **Invite**.

Once shared, the item will appear in the recipient’s **Shared with me** section, and a new entry will be visible in the users' **Links** page

## Preview

## Permission levels

For every project, asset, or collection, you can assign one of these access levels:

- **Full access**: edit content and reshare with others.
- **Can edit**: edit but cannot change permissions.
- **Can comment**: leave feedback but not edit.
- **Can view**: view only, no editing or commenting.

<Callout type="info">
  Permissions are granular: you can give one user comment-only access to a project while giving another full access.
</Callout>

## Share with a team

You can also share directly with an entire **team** inside your workspace:

- Hover over a team in the sidebar and create a new project inside it.
- Or drag an existing project into the team folder.

Projects inside a default team are visible to everyone in the workspace.

## Share with a guest

Guests are people outside your organization (e.g., clients, contractors).\
They can be invited to specific projects or assets with limited permissions.

<Callout type="info">
  If your workspace has a guest limit or has restricted guest access, you may not be able to invite external users. Contact your admin for details.
</Callout>

---

## General access

In the share menu, you can set **general access**:

- **Only invited**: private, only invited members/guests can see.
- **Everyone in workspace**: any member can search for and open.
- **Anyone with link**: shareable link; no login required to view (comments/editing require a Wikio account).

Admins on Enterprise plans can disable public links in **Settings \> Security**.

---

## Manage permissions

To change someone’s permission:

1. Open the **Share** menu on the item.
2. Find the person, group, or team.
3. Use the dropdown to select a new permission level.

To remove access, select **Remove**.

---

## Stop sharing

- Drag the project back into your **Private** section.
- Or open the share menu and remove all users/groups.

Once removed, users lose access immediately.

---

## Request access

If you try to open a project you don’t have permission for, you’ll see a **Request access** option. The owner will be notified and can grant or deny your request.

---

## Notes on inheritance

- Sub-projects or nested assets inherit the permissions of their parent by default.
- Team owners can set **default permissions** for all new projects in their team.
- Moving an item to a private section overrides previous sharing.

---

## Best practices

- Share with **teams** rather than individuals when possible.
- Use **comment-only access** for feedback rounds with clients.
- Be cautious with **Anyone with link**—it’s best for public campaigns or published assets.
