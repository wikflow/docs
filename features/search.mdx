Search history helps you pick up where you left off. It lists your recent queries with their filters so you can rerun results in one click.

## What is saved

- The query text  
- Time of the search  

<Callout type="info">
Search history records all activities. You will be able to see other usersâ€™ searches if you are an admin.
</Callout>

## Open search history

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open search">
    Use the search entry in the top bar or the search shortcut in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rerun past search">
    - Click any entry to rerun it with the same query and filters.
    - Use the overflow menu on an entry to **Open in new tab** if you want to keep your current results.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Clear items

You control what stays in history.

- **Remove one** entry from its menu
- **Select a few items** and then Delete them
- **Clear all** entries

<Callout type="warning">
Clearing is permanent. It does not affect saved searches you created separately.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

- **I do not see any entries:** make a search first, then check the **History** tab.  
- **A query did not rerun as expected:** filters or data may have changed since the original search. Review filters before running.  
- **I cleared items by mistake:** clearing cannot be undone.
