Search history helps you pick up where you left off. It lists your recent queries with their filters so you can rerun results in one click.

## What is saved

- The query text  
- Applied filters (type, date, workspace scope, etc.)  
- Time of the search  
- Optional note if you added one  
- Pin state if you pinned it

Search history records only your own activity. It does not include other usersâ€™ searches.

## Open search history

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open search">
    Use the search entry in the top bar or the search shortcut in the app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Switch to History">
    Select the **History** tab to see your recent searches.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Rerun a past search

- Click any entry to rerun it with the same query and filters.  
- Use the overflow menu on an entry to **Open in new tab** if you want to keep your current results.

## Pin and organize

- **Pin** a search to keep it at the top of the list.  
- **Add note** to document why the search matters.  
- **Sort** by most recent, most used, or pinned first.  
- **Filter** the history view by date range.

## Edit or duplicate a search

1. Select an entry.  
2. Click **Edit query** to tweak the text or filters, then **Save as new** to keep the original.  
3. Or choose **Duplicate** from the menu to create a copy you can adjust.

## Clear items

You control what stays in history.

- **Remove one** entry from its menu  
- **Clear unpinned** entries  
- **Clear all** entries

<Callout type="warning">
Clearing is permanent. It does not affect saved searches you created separately.
</Callout>

## Saved searches vs history

- **History** is automatic and chronological.  
- **Saved searches** are manual and curated. They appear in the **Saved** tab and can be shared if your plan supports sharing.  

Use **Save** on any result page to turn a history entry into a saved search.

## Troubleshooting

- **I do not see any entries:** make a search first, then check the **History** tab.  
- **A query did not rerun as expected:** filters or data may have changed since the original search. Review filters before running.  
- **I cleared items by mistake:** clearing cannot be undone. Consider using saved searches for long term needs.
