Wikio keeps you updated on activity that matters to you. You can review alerts in the app and, if you choose, get email updates.

## What you get notified about

- Successful upload and processing of assets
- Invites and member changes that affect your access
- Mentions on projects and items you are involved in
- Workflow updates such as transcript, subtitle, or dubbing runs finishing
- Project or item activity you follow
- Admin updates for your workspace

These event types map to the core app areas and workflows defined in the product plan.

## Where notifications appear

- **In-app:** click the bell icon to open the notifications panel. Unread items are grouped by time so you can scan and act quickly.
- **Email:** optional emails can be sent for important events like mentions and invites. You can turn these on or off in your settings.

## Manage your preferences

You control which alerts you receive and how you receive them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open account settings">
    Go to **Settings** from the main app navigation, then choose **Account settings**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open notifications">
    Select **Notifications**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose delivery">
    For each event type, choose **In-app**, **Email**, or both.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Your choices apply right away. You can change them any time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Account settings and the notifications page are part of the Level 1 settings area.

## Troubleshooting

- **Not getting emails:** check your spam folder and add `support@wikio.ai` to your allow list.
- **Too many alerts:** review your preferences in **Account settings â†’ Notifications** and reduce event types or switch some to in-app only.
- **Panel not opening:** make sure you are signed in and that no browser extension blocks the panel.
