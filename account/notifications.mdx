Wikio keeps you updated on activity that matters to you. You can review alerts in the app and, if you choose, get email updates. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## What you get notified about

- Successful upload and processing of assets
- Invites and member changes that affect your access
- Mentions on projects and items you are involved in  
- Workflow updates such as transcript, subtitle, or dubbing runs finishing  
- Project or item activity you follow  
- Admin updates for your workspace

These event types map to the core app areas and workflows defined in the product plan. 

## Where notifications appear

- **In app:** click the bell icon in the interface to open the notifications panel. Unread items are grouped by time so you can scan and act quickly. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Email:** optional emails can be sent for important events like mentions and invites. You can turn these on or off in your settings. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
