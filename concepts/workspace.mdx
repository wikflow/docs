The Workspace is the top-level unit in Wikio. It represents your organization and is managed by the Owner (Super Admin). Admins can modify workspace settings and manage members.

## Workspace details

The Admin has the ability to change parameters such as

- Workspace name,
- Workspace Icon
- Workspace URL (in the future the URL but it does not make sense right now with our set-up)

The Admin can view

- The Region will be shown (Read-only)

The Superadmin (Owner) will have the ability to delete a workspace but this won't be done for the first release

# Workspace architecture

A Workspace has

- a set of members
- a set of projects
- a set of assets
- a set of configuration and rules (Security and access, configuration of teams etc…)
- a service plan (Free trial, Enterprise etc…)
- a billing details (the details to put on the Invoice)
- usage analytics (we will make this visible to the Admin)

# Members (People)

A dedicated page will be done for managing Members

Members

On top of managing members manually, we will have the ability to

- Create an invite link to add members to the workspace
- Add members via a connection to Google, Slack (or something else)

A member can be added manually by click on Add members

## Invite Members

There are two ways to Invite members

→ Share the Invite Link (if enabled in the Members section)

→ Share with the Invite Pop-up (see below)

The Invite Members pop-up will require a

- adding emails (separated with commas)
- selecting a role (by default people are added as Admin)
