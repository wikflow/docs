An asset is any media file you upload to Wikio: videos, images, audio files, or documents. Assets are the building blocks of your library—they can be organized into projects, searched with AI, and transformed through workflows.

## What counts as an asset

| Type | Formats |
|---|---|
| **Video** | MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, WebM |
| **Image** | JPG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, WebP |
| **Audio** | MP3, WAV, AAC, FLAC |
| **Document** | PDF (for briefs, scripts, guidelines) |

Each uploaded file becomes a distinct asset with its own metadata, tags, and history.

## Upload assets

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your workspace">
    Navigate to the workspace or project where you want to add files.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload">
    Click **Upload** or drag files directly into the browser window. You can upload multiple files at once.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for processing">
    Wikio analyzes each asset—extracting metadata, generating thumbnails, and running AI indexing. Progress appears in the upload panel.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## AI indexing

Once uploaded, Wikio's AI automatically processes each asset:

- **Transcription**: Spoken words are converted to searchable text.
- **Visual analysis**: Scenes, objects, and faces are detected and tagged.
- **Auto-tagging**: Relevant keywords are added based on content.

This indexing lets you search by what's said or shown in a video, not just by filename or manual tags.

## Asset details

Click an asset to open its detail view:

- **Preview**: Watch video or view images with the built-in player.
- **Metadata**: See file size, duration, resolution, upload date, and uploader.
- **Tags**: View auto-generated and manually added tags.
- **Transcription**: Read the full transcript (for video and audio).
- **Activity**: Track who viewed, edited, or commented on the asset.

## Organize assets

### Tags

Add custom tags to group related assets:

1. Open the asset detail view.
2. Click **Add tag** and enter your label.
3. Use tags to filter search results later.

### Collections

Group assets into collections for easy access:

- Create a collection from the sidebar.
- Drag assets into the collection or use the **Add to collection** menu.
- Collections can be shared with specific teammates or clients.

### Projects

Assign assets to projects to track production progress:

- Raw footage goes into a project as input.
- Versions and edits live alongside the originals.
- The final deliverable becomes the project's Master Release.

## Search assets

Use the search bar to find assets by:

- **Keywords**: Match tags, titles, or descriptions.
- **Spoken words**: Find the exact moment someone says a phrase.
- **Visual content**: Search for scenes containing specific objects or actions.

Filter results by date, file type, project, or tag to narrow down large libraries.

## Asset versions

When you edit or transform an asset, Wikio can create a new version rather than replacing the original:

- **Version history**: See all iterations of an asset in one place.
- **Compare**: Toggle between versions to review changes.
- **Restore**: Roll back to a previous version if needed.

<Callout type="warning">
Deleting an asset removes all its versions. Move assets to a private archive if you might need them later.
</Callout>

## Sharing assets

Share individual assets or entire collections:

1. Click **Share** on the asset or collection.
2. Enter collaborator emails or select teammates.
3. Choose permission level: view, comment, edit, or full access.

Shared assets appear in the recipient's **Shared with me** section.

## Analytics

Track how assets are used:

- **Views**: See how many times an asset was opened.
- **Downloads**: Count exports and file downloads.
- **Engagement**: For shared assets, see viewer activity over time.

Analytics help you understand which content resonates and how your library is being used.

## Best practices

- **Name files clearly**: Descriptive names make manual searching easier alongside AI search.
- **Add context tags**: Even with AI tagging, manual labels for campaigns or projects improve organization.
- **Archive instead of delete**: Move outdated assets to an archive collection rather than deleting—storage is often cheaper than recreating lost work.
- **Use projects for production**: Keep raw footage and deliverables together in a project to maintain context.
