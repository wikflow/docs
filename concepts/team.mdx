Teams group people who work together on shared projects. Instead of inviting individuals to each project separately, you can add them to a team and grant access to everything the team owns.

## Why use teams

- **Simplify permissions**: Share projects with a team instead of listing every person.
- **Organize by function**: Create teams for editors, reviewers, clients, or departments.
- **Scale collaboration**: As your workspace grows, teams keep access manageable.

## Create a team

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open workspace settings">
    Click your workspace name in the sidebar and select **Settings**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Teams">
    Navigate to the **Teams** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new team">
    Click **New team**, enter a name and optional description, then click **Create**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
Only Workspace Owners and Admins can create teams. Members can join existing teams but cannot create new ones.
</Callout>

## Add members to a team

1. Open the team from **Settings > Teams**.
2. Click **Add members**.
3. Search for existing workspace members or invite new people by email.
4. Select a role for each person (see roles below).
5. Click **Add**.

New members immediately gain access to all projects shared with the team.

## Team roles

Each team member has a role that controls what they can do within that team's projects:

| Role | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| **Team Admin** | Manage team settings, add or remove members, and edit all team projects |
| **Editor** | Create and edit projects, upload assets, run workflows |
| **Reviewer** | View projects, leave comments, approve versions—cannot edit |
| **Viewer** | View-only access to team projects |

Roles are specific to each team. A person can be an Admin in one team and a Viewer in another.

## Assign projects to a team

Projects can belong to a team so all members have access:

- **Create inside a team**: Hover over the team in the sidebar and click **New project**. The project automatically inherits team permissions.
- **Move an existing project**: Drag a project into the team folder, or open the project settings and change its team assignment.

<Callout type="warning">
Moving a project to a team may grant access to people who didn't have it before. Review team membership before moving sensitive projects.
</Callout>

## Default team

Each workspace has a default team that includes all workspace members. Projects placed in the default team are visible to everyone.

Use the default team for:

- Company-wide announcements or shared resources.
- Templates that anyone can duplicate.
- Reference materials like brand guidelines.

Keep sensitive or client-specific work in dedicated teams with limited membership.

## Remove members

1. Open the team settings.
2. Find the member you want to remove.
3. Click the menu icon and select **Remove from team**.

Removed members lose access to the team's projects immediately, unless they have individual access granted separately.

## Delete a team

1. Go to **Settings > Teams**.
2. Select the team and click **Delete team**.
3. Confirm the deletion.

Deleting a team does not delete its projects. Projects remain in the workspace and can be reassigned to another team or moved to a member's private space.

## Best practices

- **Name teams clearly**: Use descriptive names like "Marketing Editors" or "Client: Acme Corp" so members understand the scope.
- **Limit team size**: Smaller, focused teams are easier to manage than large, general-purpose ones.
- **Use reviewers for clients**: Give external stakeholders Reviewer access so they can comment without editing.
- **Audit regularly**: Periodically review team membership to remove people who no longer need access.
