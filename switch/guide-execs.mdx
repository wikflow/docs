# Primary objection: New AI software?

### Our current tools aren't perfect, but "work fine".

Your team may think their current knowledge management and collaboration tools "work fine", but the reality is that they're slow and disconnected for those who use them most. If you dig into things like how your team searches for information, shares knowledge across departments, or onboards new employees, you will likely uncover deep inefficiencies.

#### The problems with "works fine" tools

Most companies are using a combination of wikis, document repositories, chat platforms, and search tools with:

**No unified intelligence layer**

Teams are jumping between multiple tools—wikis, Google Drive, Slack, Confluence, Notion—with no way to intelligently search across all sources. Critical knowledge is trapped in silos, leading to duplicated work and missed insights.

**Poor search and discovery**

Traditional search tools require you to know exactly what you're looking for and where it lives. Teams waste hours hunting for information that exists somewhere in the organization, or worse, they recreate work that's already been done.

**Knowledge fragmentation**

Important context lives in Slack threads, meeting notes live in Google Docs, code documentation lives in GitHub, and product specs live in Jira. No single person has a complete picture, and onboarding new team members becomes an archaeological expedition.

#### Business impact

These problems with "works fine" tools have very real business consequences:

**Productivity drain**

Studies show knowledge workers spend 19% of their time searching for information. For a 50-person engineering team, that's 10 full-time employees' worth of productivity lost to searching for information that already exists somewhere in your organization.

**Innovation slowdown**

When teams can't easily discover what's been built, learned, or decided before, they waste time reinventing the wheel. The best ideas and solutions remain hidden in scattered documents instead of accelerating future innovation.

**Onboarding inefficiency**

New employees spend weeks or months piecing together tribal knowledge from scattered sources. Without intelligent knowledge access, ramp-up time is 2-3x longer than necessary, delaying their contribution to the business.

**Decision-making quality**

Leaders make critical decisions without full context because relevant information is buried across multiple systems. They miss important insights simply because they didn't know where to look or what to search for.

Wikio AI was built from the ground up to solve these problems. It's an intelligent knowledge platform that understands your entire organization's information and makes it instantly accessible to everyone who needs it.

#### The Wikio AI difference

When customers switch to Wikio AI, we see:

**3x faster information retrieval**

Teams find the information they need in seconds, not hours. Wikio AI understands context and intent, surfacing relevant information across all your tools even when you don't know exactly what to search for.

**60% reduction in duplicate work**

By making existing knowledge discoverable, teams stop recreating documentation, analysis, and solutions that already exist. They build on what came before instead of starting from scratch.

**50% faster onboarding**

New employees get up to speed dramatically faster with instant access to all organizational knowledge, contextualized answers to their questions, and intelligent suggestions for what they should learn next.

**5x increase in cross-functional knowledge sharing**

When knowledge becomes accessible, teams naturally share more. Engineering learns from product, product learns from sales, and breakthrough insights emerge from unexpected connections.

The question isn't about how much better Wikio AI is—it's how much productivity is lost each week by sticking with "works fine" tools. Given that knowledge work and decision-making drive your organization's value creation, the productivity gains Wikio AI offers would justify this switch many times over.

To build a business case for making the switch to Wikio AI, we recommend running a pre- and post-evaluation survey to provide both the quantitative evidence and qualitative anecdotes to illustrate that moving to Wikio AI will have an impact on team productivity and satisfaction.

> **"My advice for anyone curious about Wikio AI is to do a pilot. The product sells itself. Within the first week, my team was finding information they'd completely forgotten existed. The questions went from 'where is that document?' to 'what else can we ask it?'"**
