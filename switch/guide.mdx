## HOW TO PITCH WIKIO AI TO IT AND OPERATIONS

### Primary objection: Another tool to manage, integrate, and secure.

Your IT and operations teams are justifiably concerned about adding complexity to an already complex tech stack. Wikio AI is designed specifically to reduce IT burden, not increase it.

#### How Wikio AI simplifies operations

**1. One integration, universal access**

Instead of managing dozens of separate integrations between tools, Wikio AI provides a single intelligent layer that connects to all your systems through standard APIs. Add one tool, gain unified access to everything.

**2. Reduces tool sprawl**

By making existing tools more discoverable and useful, Wikio AI often reduces the need for additional specialized search, knowledge management, and collaboration tools. Teams stop requesting new tools because they can't find information in existing ones.

**3. Automated provisioning and deprovisioning**

Wikio AI syncs with your identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace) to automatically manage access. When employees join or leave, Wikio AI access updates automatically—no manual ticket required.

**4. Infrastructure flexibility**

Deploy Wikio AI in the way that works for your organization:

- SaaS with data processing in your VPC
- On-premises deployment for maximum control
- Hybrid configurations for specific compliance needs

**5. Reduced support burden**

When employees can find information instantly instead of submitting IT help desk tickets for access requests, password resets, or "where is X?" questions, your support team handles fewer interruptions.

James Park, Director of IT at InnovateCo, explains:

> **"I was skeptical about adding another tool, but Wikio AI actually reduced our IT burden. We get fewer access requests because people can find what they need, onboarding new tools is faster because Wikio AI indexes them automatically, and we eliminated three separate search and knowledge tools we were paying for. It's one of the few 'productivity tools' that actually reduced complexity."**

### Objection 2: How do we ensure data governance and compliance?

#### Built-in governance from day one

Wikio AI provides enterprise-grade governance controls:

**1. Granular access policies**

- Define which teams or individuals can access which data sources
- Set organization-wide policies that automatically apply to new data sources
- Create exceptions for sensitive information requiring additional approval

**2. Data retention compliance**

- Automatically respect retention policies from source systems
- Configure custom retention rules for AI-generated summaries and insights
- Provide audit-ready reports showing what information was accessed and when

**3. Sensitive information detection**

- Automatically identify and flag PII, financial data, or custom sensitive patterns
- Require additional authentication for accessing high-sensitivity information
- Redact or mask sensitive data in AI responses based on user permissions

**4. Regulatory compliance support**

- SOC 2 Type II certified infrastructure
- GDPR-compliant data handling with data subject request support
- HIPAA-ready deployment options for healthcare organizations
- Regular third-party security audits and penetration testing

**5. Complete audit trails**

- Log every query, access, and interaction for compliance and security review
- Export audit logs to your SIEM or data warehouse
- Generate compliance reports showing who accessed what, when, and why

Your compliance and legal teams can review Wikio AI's security documentation and conduct their own assessment before deployment.

## GETTING STARTED WITH WIKIO AI

### Recommended rollout approach

**Phase 1: Pilot (2-4 weeks)**

- Select a champion team (10-20 people) who are dealing with significant knowledge friction
- Connect their most critical 3-5 data sources
- Provide hands-on training and gather detailed feedback
- Measure time saved and satisfaction metrics

**Phase 2: Expand (1-2 months)**

- Roll out to additional teams based on pilot success
- Connect more data sources progressively
- Build internal champions who can support their peers
- Develop organization-specific best practices

**Phase 3: Scale (ongoing)**

- Open access to the entire organization
- Connect remaining data sources
- Enable advanced features like automatic documentation generation
- Measure organization-wide productivity impact

### Success metrics to track

- **Time saved per employee**: Survey-based before/after comparison of time spent searching for information
- **Information discovery**: Number of queries per user, indicating active usage and value
- **Onboarding velocity**: Time to productivity for new employees
- **Knowledge reuse**: Reduction in duplicate documentation or repeated work
- **User satisfaction**: NPS or CSAT scores for the tool

### Resources to support your switch

- **Migration guide**: Step-by-step technical implementation checklist
- **Training materials**: Self-serve videos, documentation, and interactive tutorials
- **Integration templates**: Pre-built configurations for common tool stacks
- **Customer success support**: Dedicated support during rollout and beyond
- **Community**: Peer learning from other organizations using Wikio AI

## FINAL THOUGHTS

The future of work is not about adopting more tools—it's about making the tools you already have work better together. Wikio AI is that intelligent layer that unlocks the collective knowledge of your organization and makes it accessible to everyone who needs it.

The teams that move fastest aren't those with the most sophisticated tools—they're the ones where knowledge flows freely, where anyone can find what they need instantly, and where institutional learning compounds over time instead of being lost.

The question isn't whether to adopt AI for knowledge work—it's whether you'll do it proactively or wait until your competitors' speed advantage becomes insurmountable.
