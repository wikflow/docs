### Primary benefit: Stop wasting time searching, start building.

For engineers, product managers, designers, and other individual contributors, Wikio AI means spending dramatically less time hunting for information and more time doing the work you were hired to do.

#### What Wikio AI does for individual contributors

**1. Instant answers to everyday questions**

- "How do I set up the development environment?"
- "What's our API rate limiting policy?"
- "Who owns the authentication service?"
- "What did we learn from the last mobile app redesign?"

Get comprehensive, cited answers in seconds instead of asking in Slack, searching through docs, or scheduling meetings.

**2. Context without interruption**

Instead of interrupting busy colleagues with questions, get the context you need immediately. Preserve your flow state and your teammates' focus.

**3. Discover hidden knowledge**

Find relevant information you didn't even know existed. Wikio AI surfaces related discussions, similar past projects, and relevant context you wouldn't have thought to search for.

**4. Learn from the past**

Instantly access institutional knowledge that would normally take months or years to accumulate. See how similar problems were solved before, learn from past experiments, and avoid repeating mistakes.

**5. Onboard faster**

New team members can self-serve answers to most questions, dramatically accelerating their ramp-up time and reducing the burden on existing team members.

Emma Watson, Senior Engineer at BuildRight, shares:

> **"Wikio AI changed how I work. I used to spend at least an hour every day searching for information, asking people questions, or waiting for responses. Now I get answers instantly and spend that time actually coding. The best part is finding information I didn't know existed—code examples, design decisions, customer insights—that make my work better."**
