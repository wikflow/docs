## How our plans and billing work

### Plans
Plans define which features and workflows are available in your workspace.  
Check the **Pricing page** for the most up-to-date information.

### Billing
Billing applies at the **workspace level**. The organization that owns the workspace receives the invoice and must pay for active members:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

- Charges are based on the number of unsuspended users (admins, members, and guests with access).  
- You can choose between **monthly** and **yearly** billing.  
- Your account is charged monthly for the number of users in your workspace.  
- Adding users mid-month does not trigger an immediate charge; they will appear on the next invoice.  
- Removing users mid-month does not generate a credit for the remainder of that cycle.  

Wikio also supports usage-based **credits** (for workflows such as transcription or translation) in some plans:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

## Manage your billing

Navigate to **Settings > Administration > Billing** to access your plan information and make updates:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.  
From here, you can:  

- View or change your plan  
- Update payment details (credit card, billing address)  
- Update the billing email  
- View billing history: past invoices and charges  
- See if any charge is failed or overdue

## Change or cancel a subscription

Workspace admins can change or cancel a subscription under **Settings > Administration > Plans**.  

- Changes take effect at the end of the billing period (end of month for monthly plans, end of year for annual).  
- We do not provide partial refunds for mid-cycle cancellations.  
- If you are not ready to commit to an annual plan, start monthly. You can upgrade to annual later to access discounted rates.  

When cancelling a paid plan:  

- No projects, assets, or users are deleted.  
- The workspace reverts to the **Free plan**, which has limited features.  
- All users in the workspace will have admin rights under the free plan.

## Add a VAT number

To add a VAT number:  

- During upgrade: select **“I’m purchasing as a business”** on the checkout page.  
- For existing subscriptions: go to **Settings > Administration > Billing > Billing details > Edit**.

## Taxes

Depending on your billing address, taxes may apply. The billing address you provide determines whether VAT or sales tax is applied and at what rate.

## Important notes

- Plans apply to a single workspace. If your company operates multiple workspaces in the future, each will require its own subscription.  
- Invite external collaborators carefully, as they also count towards billing:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.
